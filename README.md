## 📝🔍 Abstract
This study explores the efficacy of various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in extracting meaningful insights from a novel corpus of golf course reviews. By comparing two feature extraction methods—Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Doc2Vec—and two topic modeling techniques—K-Means clustering and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)—this research aims to determine the best approaches for analyzing textual data related to golf course experiences. The proprietary dataset comprises 60 reviews of the top 30 ranked golf courses in the United States, providing a unique context for evaluating these techniques.
